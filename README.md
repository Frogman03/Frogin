# Frogin
My first minecraft plugin mini-project if the project is completed. If not i will try to keep this up to date  
This shall be managed by me and possibly be used in some servers if deemed attractive to what the server admins/ owner is trying to find.  
Currently this plugin has 1 functionality which is to say a "hello, frog" after the world has loaded and "bye bye froggie" when the server shuts down.  
I am very new to coding so adding plugin functions can be quite challenging at times for me
